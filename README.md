### Project Description
The Chappathi Roundness Meter analyzes an uploaded photo of a chappathi to measure how round it is using image processing. It then gives fun, culturally relevant comments in Malayalam based on the roundness score. This project combines technology with local flavor to entertain and help users improve their cooking skills.



### The Problem
Making perfectly round chappathis is a skill that requires practice. Beginners often struggle with uneven shapes, affecting not only the appearance but also the cooking consistency. Currently, there is no automated, fun, and interactive way to measure the roundness of chappathis.

### The Solution
We propose a computer vision-based tool that measures roundness uses image processing to analyze the chappathi‚Äôs shape and calculates its circularity and provides gives humorous comments in Malayalam
